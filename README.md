Hardware: Arduino uno, ultrasonic sensors, DHT11, BMP180, 16*2 LCD, led-lights, fan

## Interactive Room
- A sustaianble project of future. Projectâ€™s objective is to make a sustainable development project while reducing the
human effort for the same. With this project we will be able to save electricity in a very efficient manner.
- A motion sensing light system which provides light wherever it senses the presence of a person. 
- Control fan speed according to the room temperature, humidity, pressure and show these parameter changes on a 16x2 LCD display.
